[Podcast.__init__ 第59集 - 和Alex Clark谈谈Pillow](http://pythonpodcast.com/alex-clark-pillow.html)

If you need to work with images the Pillow is the library to use. The Python Image Libary (PIL) has long been the gold standard for resizing, analyzing, and processing pictures in Python. Pillow is the modern fork that is bringing the PIL into the future so that we can all continue to use it moving forward. This week I spoke with Alex Clark about what first led him to fork the project and his experience maintaining it, including the migration to Python 3.

[SortedContainers Performance at Scale](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/performance-scale.html)

SortedContainers scales extremely well. This page discusses why both in theory and in practice. The design of SortedContainers permits testing through tens of billions of items and benchmarks present results at this scale. The results of this page would be difficult and expensive to replicate with other implementations.
