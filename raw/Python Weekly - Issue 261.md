[Working with streaming data: Using the Twitter API to capture tweets](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/streaming-data-python/)  

Being able to work with streaming data is a critical skill for any aspiring
data scientist. In this post, we'll talk about strategies for working with
streaming data, and walk through an example where we stream and store data
from Twitter.  
  
[A bite of Python](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2592591)

[Episode #75: Pythonic games at CheckIO](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/75/pythonic-games-at-checkio)  
Do you like to play games or solve puzzles? Chances are pretty good that you
do. After all, what is programming and software development but one really
elaborate puzzle? On this episode, you meet someone who pushed this idea of
programming as a game to its logical conclusion. Alexander Liabakh is the
creator of CheckIO and Empire of Code. CheckIO is a programming adventure game
where you solve puzzles and share them with fellow players. Empire of Code is
a tower defense game where part of the strategy is to actually program AI in
Python.  
  
[A Technical Primer On Causality](https://medium.com/@akelleh/a-technical- primer-on-causality-181db2575e41)  
What does "causality" mean, and how can you represent it mathematically? How
can you encode causal assumptions, and what bearing do they have on data
analysis? These types of questions are at the core of the practice of data
science, but deep knowledge about them is surprisingly uncommon. If you
analyze data without regard to causality, you open your results up for the
possibility of enormous biases. This includes everything from recommendation
system results, to post-hoc reports on observational data, to experiments run
without proper holdout groups. This post covers causality at a more technical
level.  
  
[Leveraging Python to Automate GIS Processes and Provide Extended Analytical Capabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmtofk8t2dg)

[Foundations for Analytics with Python: From Non-Programmer to Hacker](http://amzn.to/2cyhD4J)  
If you're like many of Excel's 750 million users, you want to do more with
your data--like repeating similar analyses over hundreds of files, or
combining data in many files for analysis at one time. This practical guide
shows ambitious non-programmers how to automate and scale the processing and
analysis of data in different formats--by using Python. After author Clinton
Brownley takes you through Python basics, you'll be able to write simple
scripts for processing data in spreadsheets as well as databases. You'll also
learn how to use several Python modules for parsing files, grouping data, and
producing statistics.
