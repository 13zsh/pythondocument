Hi there folks. I have come to see that most new python programmers have a
hard time figuring out the *args and **kwargs magic variables. So what are
they ? First of all let me tell you that it is not necessary to write *args or
**kwargs. Only the * (aesteric) is necessary. You could have also written *var
and **vars. Writing *args and **kwargs is just a convention. So now lets take
a look at *args first.

** Usage of *args **  
*args and **kwargs are mostly used in function definitions. *args and **kwargs allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. What does variable mean here is that you do not know before hand that how many arguments can be passed to your function by the user so in this case you use these two keywords. *args is used to send a **non-keyworded** variable length argument list to the function. Here's an example to help you get a clear idea:
[code]

    
    def test_var_args(f_arg, *argv):
        print "first normal arg:", f_arg
        for arg in argv:
            print "another arg through *argv :", arg
    
    test_var_args('yasoob','python','eggs','test')
    
[/code]

This produces the following result:

[code]

    
    first normal arg: yasoob
    another arg through *argv : python
    another arg through *argv : eggs
    another arg through *argv : test
    
[/code]

I hope this cleared away any confusion that you had. So now lets talk about
**kwargs

**Usage of **kwargs**  
**kwargs allows you to pass **keyworded** variable length of arguments to a function. You should use **kwargs if you want to handle **named arguments** in a function. Here is an example to get you going with it:
[code]

    
    def greet_me(**kwargs):
        if kwargs is not None:
            for key, value in kwargs.iteritems():
                print "%s == %s" %(key,value)
     
    >>> greet_me(name="yasoob")
    name == yasoob
    
[/code]

So can you see how we handled a keyworded argument list in our function. This
is just the basics of **kwargs and you can see how useful it is. Now lets talk
about how you can use *args and **kwargs to call a function with a list or
dictionary of arguments.

**Using *args and **kwargs to call a function**  
So here we will see how to call a function using *args and **kwargs. Just
consider that you have this little function:

[code]

    
    def test_args_kwargs(arg1, arg2, arg3):
        print "arg1:", arg1
        print "arg2:", arg2
        print "arg3:", arg3
    
[/code]

Now you can use *args or **kwargs to pass arguments to this little function.
Here's how to do it:

[code]

    
    # first with *args
    >>> args = ("two", 3,5)
    >>> test_args_kwargs(*args)
    arg1: two
    arg2: 3
    arg3: 5
    
    # now with **kwargs:
    >>> kwargs = {"arg3": 3, "arg2": "two","arg1":5}
    >>> test_args_kwargs(**kwargs)
    arg1: 5
    arg2: two
    arg3: 3
    
[/code]

**Order of using *args **kwargs and formal args**  
So if you want to use all three of these in functions then the order is

[code]

    
    some_func(fargs,*args,**kwargs)
    
[/code]

I hope you have understood the usage of *args and **kwargs. If you have got
any problems or confusions with this then feel free to comment below. For
further study i suggest the official [python docs on defining
functions](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-
functions) and [*args and **kwargs on
stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3394835/args-and-kwargs).

Thank you! It's the best explanation I've read but I don't really see the
point in them.

In PHP we just pass variables onto functions. A variable can be wellâ€¦
anything. A number, a string, an array or even a multidimensional array - can
all be handled by just saying:

function hello($some_variable) {  
//do some stuff  
}

In PHP the function doesn't really care what gets passed to it. Whether you
through into the function, PHP will deal with it. So, if PHP is able to live
quite happily without args and kwargs, how come Python seems to have a problem
here?

This is not a loaded question. It's a sincere question from a dude who is
trying to learn. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Many thanks,

-DC

Python is dynamically typed language.  
Python functions really doesn't care about what you pass to them.  
But you got it the wrong wayâ€¦ please re-read the post.  
If you want to pass one thousand arguments to your function, then you can't
explicitly define every parameter in your function definition. For the reason
you will use *args and your function will be automagically able to handle all
the arguments you pass to them for you.

Awesomeâ€¦. doubt clearedâ€¦ thanks a lot..ðŸ™‚

Notice one thing: **kwargs arrange keys in alphabetical order  
e.g:

def print_it(f_arg, **kwargs):  
print f_arg  
for key,value in kwargs.iteritems():  
print "%s=%s"%(key,value)

print_it('sumer',name='panda',age=12)

output:

sumer  
age=12  
name=panda

'age' gets printed before 'name'

once againâ€¦.this post helped me a lotâ€¦. thanks dude.

For Python3 now please note a difference:  
in the first example for usage of **kwargs the line that has this:  
for key, value in kwargs.iteritems():

gave me an error because it needs to be:  
for key, value in kwargs.items():

since iteritems() no longer is defined in Python3 because items() can do the
same thing.

In the second paragraph, you've said:

"*args is used to send a non-keyworded variable length argument list to the
function".

As far as I understand, what you're passing is any number of non-keyworded
arguments in the function call. But NOT in a list. Am I wrong?

Thanks for the article : )

When using **kwargs, we call those 'keyword' arguments.  
But in Python, I thought 'keyword' referred to Python keywords like 'if',
'else', 'while', 'for', etc.  
I'm guessing the term 'keyword' means two completely different things
depending on the context (Python language keywords vs. keyword arguments) but
I wasn't sure, can someone clarify?
